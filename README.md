This is a python3.13 and django based website for a quizzing and voting. 
to run you must have python 3.13 installed and create a basic venv.

It should be inclusive and should not require an account, ID or such
simple, elegant, functional, trustable and straight forward, 
as simple as scanning a qrcode and know its just your peers that are voting

weather its to decide to have a different time for a meeting or to postpone a quiz
in a classroom, this tool should come in handy.
